# FPGA Addon Custom Device

The **FPGA Addon Custom Device** allows users to pull an existing FPGA bitfile into NI VeriStand with little or no modification. The FPGA bitfile does not need to meet the standard NI VeriStand FPGA framework (doesn't require two DMA channels or XML descriptor file). It also provides support for streaming data over DMA to a VeriStand waveform. This is not supported by the standard NI VeriStand FPGA framework.
The add-on uses LabVIEW FPGA Advanced Session Resources. This requires an update to an RT INI file. This file must be updated and the RT target rebooted. The add-on automatically updates the file for the user but it does not reboot the controller. Therefore, the first deployment will likely return an error. Reboot the controller after first deployment and everything should work fine after that.
The add-on requires an IRQ to fire on the FPGA before it starts.
The add-on does not provide a way to synchronize data acquisition/generation with the VeriStand PCL (supported in the standard NI VeriStand FPGA framework) and it does not support providing timing for VeriStand (supported in the standard NI VeriStand FPGA framework).
