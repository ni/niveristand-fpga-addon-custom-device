# DMA Channels Interleaved Example:

The **DMA Channels Interleaved Example** folder contains code that demonstrate the use of waveforms with the FPGA Addon.

The folder includes:
- A LabVIEW project used to generate a bitfile compatible with the FPGA Addon.
- A VeriStand project to demonstrate the use of the generated bitfile.
- A `Basic Waveform Read Example.vi`

You can generate a bitfile for your specific target from the LabVIEW project.

1. Open `LabVIEW FPGA Project\DMA Channels FPGA.lvproj`.
2. Add your target.
3. Move the `FPGA Personality.vi` under the newly added target.
4. Right Click on the `FPGA Personality.vi` -> Create Build Specification.
5. Right Click on the new Build Specification -> Build.

**Note:** If you wish different logic:
- Add waveforms of interest to DMA Channels.
- It is a requirement for the FPGA code to have an IRQ (address of 30) to control when the FPGA bitfile starts. This IRQ only needs to control when DMA read/write operations start
- Any other code can start whenever it makes sense. 

6. Open the `VeriStand Project\VS FPGA Addon Interleaved Example.nivsproj`.
7. Open the *System Definition* and navigate to the FPGA Addon under Custom Devices.
8. Under *Bitfile path*, browse for the newly created bitfile generated for your target.
9. Set the *RIO Device* to match your target.
10. Save and Deploy the system definition.
11. Open the `LabVIEW Host\Basic Waveform Read Example.vi` and run it.
12. The *Valid Measurements?* indicator should be True and the *Waveform* Graph should be populated with data.

## Exemple details
### `LabVIEW FPGA Project\DMA Channels FPGA.lvproj` is a LabVIEW project used to generate a bitfile for the FPGA Addon.
- In the current configuration, the bitfile is generated for a PXIe-7858R target.
- A different target can be added to the project and the `FPGA Personality.vi` can be used to generate a compatible bitfile for the new target.
   
### `VeriStand Project\VS FPGA Addon Interleaved Example.nivsproj` is a VeriStand project that contains a configured FPGA Addon using the bitfile generated from `LabVIEW FPGA Project\DMA Channels FPGA.lvproj`.
- Target Operating System is Windows.
- *RIO Device* is: `rio://10.113.0.134/RIO1` to access the PXIe-7858R target.
 
### `LabVIEW Host\Basic Waveform Read Example.vi` reads a Waveform from a deployed VeriStand system.
- After the System Definition from `VeriStand Project\VS FPGA Addon Interleaved Example.nivsproj` is deployed, the `Basic Waveform Read Example.vi` can be run.
- When running, it will read a waveform and get the array cycle in order to populate the *Waveform* Graph.
