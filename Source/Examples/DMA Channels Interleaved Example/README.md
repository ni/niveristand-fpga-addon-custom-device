# **The DMA Channels Interleaved Example contains 3 sections:**

## 1) The project used to generate a bitfile for the FPGA Addon Custom device
   - Namely, the DMA Channels FPGA.lvproj;
   - The bitfile is generated for a PXIe-7858R target;
   - Users can add a different target in the project and use the FPGA Personality.vi to generate a bitfile for another target;
   
## 2) The Veristand project that has the System Definition that contains the FPGA Addon Custom Device with the previously mentioned bitfile
   - Namely, the Veristand FPGA Addon Interleaved Example.nivsproj  
   - The Controller is setup with a Windows OS;
   - The FPGA Addon is pointed to a remote RIO resource (rio://10.113.0.134/RIO1 ) to access the PXIe-7858R target;
   - Users can modify the System Definition and load their generated bitfile (mentioned at section 1), aswell as change the rio resource;
 
## 3) The Basic Waveform Read Example.vi
   - the System Definition mentioned at section 2) needs to be deployed;
   - if successful, the Basic Waveform Read Example.vi can be run;
   - it contains 2 subVIs (one reads a waveform and the other gets the array cycle );
   - it contains logic that reads and outputs a waveform;
   
# **Instructions on how to run the example:**

### 1) Open the DMA Channels FPGA.lvproj and add the target available;  
### 2) Move the FPGA Personality.vi under the newly added target and compile it;  
#### **Note1:** If you wish different logic:
   - put waveforms of interest to DMA channels;
   - IT IS A REQUIREMENT TO THE FPGA CODE TO HAVE AN IRQ (ADDRESS OF 30) TO CONTROL WHEN THE FPGA BITFILE STARTS;
   - THIS IRQ ONLY NEEDS TO CONTROL WHEN DMA READ/WRITE OPERATIONS START; 
   - Any other code can start whenever it makes sense;  
#### **Note2:** Below are two examples showing DMA, controls, and indicators (one containing DMA channels, other containing scalar channels)

### 3) Open the Veristand FPGA Addon Interleaved Example.nivsproj;
### 4) Open the System Definition and go to the FPGA Addon Custom Device;
### 5) Under Bitfile Path, browse for the newly created bitfile generated for your available target;
### 6) Set the RIO resource to match your target;
### 7) Under Waveform Inputs, add Outgoing1 again (Browsing for a new bitfile clears all the inputs and outputs from the FPGA Addon);
### 8) Save and deploy the system definition;   
### 9) Open the Basic Waveform Read Example.vi and run it;
### 10) The Valid Measurements? indicator should be true and the Waveform should be populated with data;
